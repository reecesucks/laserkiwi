Game is pretty much good to go in pygame. Waiting for hardware components to arrive before I make it into a physical arcade game.

In the meantime, I am converting it to javascript so it can be played online.
This is actually the best thing I've ever made.
Play it at reecesucks.com/laserkiwi/index.html

TO DO:
-Intro screen
-Menu with settings
-Background music works if you allow auto playing audio on firefox. Haven't tested on other browers set
-Add sound effects
